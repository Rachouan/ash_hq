  Happy Holidays!
</div>

This year has been a wild ride ðŸŽ¢. So much has gone into Ash Framework this year, and our user base has increased *massively* in that time frame, and there is *so much* more to come. We have some huge things just around the river bend ðŸŽ‰, and I can't wait for you all to see it!

    This message was not built by or with the use of any ML algorithms. There is a place for generated content, but a thank you to my users and the community is not that place.
</div>

When I set out to build Ash, **it was about technology**ðŸ’». It was about what I felt was missing from the Elixir ecosystem and from the programming ecosystem in general. It was something I believed in, and something that I thought other people would want to use, but it was fundamentally about what I wanted. Then the users started trickling in, and **it became about a whole lot more**. This work has become so much more meaningful than I ever thought it could be and, perhaps a bit delusionally, I think this project can make a **real difference** on the lives and livelihoods of the people that I've come to care so deeply about. Just like the amazing people who built Elixir and its community up to what it is today. That is what this project is about for me now, and it is what keeps me going.

## Community

I'd like to start by thanking the community ðŸ«‚ in general, which is exemplified by the [Ash Framework Discord](https://discord.gg/D7FNG2q). It has become a thriving place, filled with wonderful and helpful people. I thought it was going to be a place for Ash Framework support, but its turned into a place for people with similar ideas about how things ought to be built to talk about anything under the sun. A few fast friendships have sprung from the community, and its been an amazing pleasure to help you all and to see you help each other. If you want to meet and learn about all these amazing folks, join us!

Last but not least, I'd like to thank my sponsors, the largest of which (if sponsor is even the correct term) is my employer [Alembic](https://alembic.com.au/). They were among the first to see the potential of what Ash could be and where it is headed. Thanks to them, I can work on or with Ash effectively full time, either by continuing to add to the framework or by helping with their various client projects using Ash.

In addition to Alembic, there are other sponsors who fund my work, both individuals and companies like [Coinbits](https://coinbits.app/). Ask anyone who knows, and they'll tell you that Ash is essentially two full time jobs for me, and these sponsorships are one of the ways that I manage the level of support and effort that I put into this project. Knowing that my work is impactful, to the point that you want to buy me a coffee (or more), is worth more than I can say. Thank you all for your support.


I can't wait to see what 2023 holds for Ash and its community. If 2022 is anything to go by, we've got a huge year ahead of us ðŸ˜Ž. I hope you all have a wonderful holiday season, and keep your eyes peeled because we have a very big announcement coming up!
